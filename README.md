## Troubleshooting

### No Assignments Found
- Ensure you're on a Canvas page with visible assignments
- Try refreshing the Canvas page and sync again
- Check browser console for error messages

### Notion Connection Failed
- Verify your Notion token starts with `secret_` or `ntn_`
- Ensure database ID is exactly 32 characters (no dashes)
- Check that integration has access to the database
- Confirm database properties match expected schema

### Sync Errors
- Check Notion API rate limits (3 requests/second)
- Verify internet connection
- Look for network blocking or firewall issues

### Canvas Detection Issues
